			<head>Hi There! My name is Stuart Parker, and this is my page. </head>
			<p>It probably looks awful, but for now that's the point :) </p>
            <p>I'm a USAF veteran and undergraduate studying Computer Science at Fordham University. I am by no means am I a wizard, and have never associated with any wizards.</p>
		    <p>Currently, this is set up to fulfill a project for my discrete structures class. I have to do a few things for my first web page. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>First, Make a bulleted list</li>
                <li>Second, Make a link to an external site <a href="https://xkcd.com">like so</a>.  </li>
                <li>As well, I must insert an image. I will do so now.  </li> </ul>

            <ul type = "circle">
                <li>There we are. What's next?</li>
                <li>Ah, <b>Bold Text, to <a href = "https://quillette.com"> highlight </a> <a href = "https://fordham.edu"> important </a> aspects</b></li>
                
    
    
            </ul>
            <p>Yup, this is surely a decent start.</p>
