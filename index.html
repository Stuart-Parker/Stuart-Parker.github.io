			<head>Hi There! My name is Stuart Parker, and this is my page. </head>
			<p>It probably looks awful, but for now that's the point :) </p>
            <p>I'm a USAF veteran an undergraduate at Fordham University, and by no means am I a wizard, and have never associated with any wizards.</p>
		    <p>Currently, this is set up to fulfill a project for my discrete structures class. I have to do a few things for my first web page. </p>
            <ul>
                <l1>First, Make a bulleted list</l1>
                <l2>Second, Make a link to an external site <a href="xkcd.com">like so</a>.  </l2>
                <l3>As well, I must insert an image. I will do so now.  </l3> </ul>
                <img src="https://www.bethelcupertino.org/llama/llama_300.jpg">
    
    
            <ul>
                <l4>There we are. What's next?</l4>
                <l5>Ah, <b>Bold Text, to highlight important aspects</b></l5>
                
    
    
            </ul>
            <p>Yup, this is surely a decent start.</p>
